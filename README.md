# 3D List Card Hover Effect

A visually engaging 3D hover interaction built using pure **HTML** and **CSS**, inspired by interactive card gallery UI patterns.  
This effect creates a dynamic perspective shift where the hovered card pops out, and cards on both sides tilt and adjust brightness — all without JavaScript.

- The active card brightens and pops out in 3D space  
- Cards on the right tilt outward with decreasing brightness
